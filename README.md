# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Server-Side Web API Challenge

During this challenge, our objective was to develop a weather app by utilizing two APIs. The first API was employed to retrieve the weather data for a given city, but it required latitude and longitude coordinates as input. To obtain these coordinates, we integrated a geolocating API, which provided us with the necessary data. By utilizing the obtained coordinates, we were able to access our second API and retrieve a five-day forecast for any city entered in the search tab. This experience proved to be crucial in grasping the workings of APIs and served as an excellent preparation for our upcoming group project.
